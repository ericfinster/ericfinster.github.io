## Homotopy Type Theory

This course will cover some more advanced topics in homotopy type theory.

### Prerequisites

I will assume some basic familiarity with basic Martin-Lof dependent
type theory.

### Resources

1. [The Homotopy Type Theory Book](https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/)
1. [Introduction to Univalent Foundations of Mathematics with Agda](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/HoTT-UF-in-Agda-Lecture-Notes/)
1. [Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11082)

### Course Topics

We will cover some of the basic concepts of homotopy type theory 
including:

1. h-Level
1. Equivalences
1. Univalence
1. Higher Inductive Types

Time permitting we will move on to more sophisticated topics like:

1. Homotopy Groups
1. Connectedness
1. Modalities
