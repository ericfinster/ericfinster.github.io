## Homotopy Type Theory

This course will cover some more advanced topics in homotopy type theory.

### Prerequisites

I will assume some basic familiarity with basic Martin-Lof dependent
type theory.

### Course Topics

We will cover some of the basic concepts of homotopy type theory 
including:

1. h-Level
1. Equivalences
1. Univalence
1. Higher Inductive Types

Time permitting we will move on to more sophisticated topics like:

1. Homotopy Groups
1. Connectedness
1. Modalities
