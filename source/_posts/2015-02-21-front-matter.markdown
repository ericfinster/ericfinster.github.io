We start with a confession: I think I have probably written this kind
of introductory message for a nascent blog about eight times.  None of
those ill-fated attempts still survives to my knowledge, but to be 
honest, I haven't checked.  And it seems likely that Google could prove
me wrong on that point.  Please don't go looking ....

In any case, it does seem appropriate to put at least *something* here
at the beginning so that things don't just start coming out of left
field.  And anyway, you should know what you're getting yourself into
by sticking around.  So with that, here we go again ...

My name is Eric Finster.  I am a mathematician by training, and the
real reason I'm starting this blog is to talk about mathematics.
Specifically, I am interested in homotopy theory, higher category
theory, and the relations between these subjects and logic and
computer science.  That's mainly the kind of thing you are likely
to find here, at least in the beginning.
