## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="files/eric.jpg">

Hi!  I'm Eric Finster.  I'm a mathematician.  Or I'm a computer
scientist.  It's a bit difficult for me to decide these days.

I grew up in Los Angeles, studied in Charlottesville, Virginia and
presently live in Paris.

## Research Interests

My main interests are higher category theory and homotopy theory, and
applications of these subjects to computer science, particularly
formal methods in software development and computer-assisted
mathematics.

I am particularly interested in the axiomatic approach to homotopy
theory provided by [Homotopy Type
Theory](http://www.homotopytypetheory.org).  Recently I've been
working a lot on the relationship between &infin;-topos theory and
Goodwillie's Calculus of Functors.

I'm also the author of a [site](http://opetopic.net) all about the
opetopes!
