## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="files/eric.jpg">

Hi!  I'm Eric Finster.  I'm a mathematician with the
[CoqHoTT](http://coqhott.gforge.inria.fr/) ERC project.

I was born in California, studied in Virginia and presently
live just outside Paris.

## Research Interests

My main interests are higher category theory and homotopy theory.  I
am particularly interested in the axiomatic approach to homotopy
theory provided by [Homotopy Type
Theory](http://www.homotopytypetheory.org).  Recently I've been
working a lot on the relationship between &infin;-topos theory and
Goodwillie's Calculus of Functors.

I'm also the author of a [site](http://opetopic.net) all about the
opetopes!
