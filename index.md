## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="files/eric.jpg">

I am a mathematcian and computer scientist currently working as a
researcher at the University of Cambridge. I grew up in Los Angeles,
studied in Charlottesville, and presently live in Paris.

## Research Interests

My main interests are higher category theory and homotopy theory, and
applications of these subjects to computer science, particularly
formal methods in software development and computer-assisted
mathematics. 

My formal training in mathematics was in homotopy theory, and I have
worked extensively on the connection between this area of topology the
[theory of types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory), a
discipline which goes by the name [Homotopy Type
Theory](http://www.homotopytypetheory.org).

I'm also the author of a [site](http://opetopic.net) all about the
opetopes.
